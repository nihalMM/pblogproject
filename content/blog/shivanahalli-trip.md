_![](/uploads/testimg-001.jpg)This was an article I Wrote during my time as a volunteer at Rotaract BMSCE._

The long trip to Shivanahalli Ashram, lasted almost 2 hours. Shivanahalli, as the name suggests is a quaint little village, which most deforesters have thankfully not  discovered. The Ashram, run by RAMAKRISHNA MISSION, has grown more than 3000 trees in an area which was barren before they control. The purpose of our visit there was to help the Ashram in their legitimate efforts to make a greener India.

The ashram covering a large area has used most of its land area to plant saplings in the barren areas thereby maintaining a small but fruitful forest. These saplings are envisioned to one day, become a part of the same forest and make a self-sufficient forest ecosystem.

Our rotaract team, as a team building exercise, watered as many saplings as we could find. For this, we firstly organized ourselves into 2 human chains stretching from the well/tank to the saplings quarter. We then started passing along pots filled with water to the saplings and empty pots ready to be refilled back. Thereby, efficiently delivering water from the tank to the plants. With this exercise, we not only introduced ourselves to the people around us, but we communicated efficiently with the whole chain. After a while, a competition started between the 2 chains on who could water more number of plants!

The day was filled with excitement, some misadventures (including a bunch of us getting lost on our way through the forest to the saplings quarter), some tasty lunch and some inspirational stories. The head swamiji of that aashram Swami Vishnumayananda gave us a whole new perspective on life which gave us something to think about on the way home. Not only did we help in making the city/country a tad bit greener but also connected with a team which would be our backbone for our future benevolent events.

Rotaractor Rohit Karthikeyan says “The experience was something to cherish. It was good meeting new people, working together as a team, mitigating contingencies and getting work done. Besides watering the plants our brief moments of interaction with the swamiji was pleasant and insightful. It was a warm break from the routine undergraduate life while being a window for making a valuable contribution to society.”
