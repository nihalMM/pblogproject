*This was an article I Wrote during my time in Rotaract BMSCE.*

Sports day at Ramana Maharishi School For The Blind.

"Om sahana vavatu. sahanao bhunaktu. sahaveeryam karavavahai.......shanti shanti shanti hi" rang through the walls of Ramana Maharishi School for the Blind as we entered the school quadrangle on the morning of 8th November,2014.

A visually impaired teacher briefed our 20 member volunteer base about the school.The school caters to the needs of visually impaired( both complete and partial) and mentally challenged children providing them with food, accommodation and education.They also have a mill within the school premises where cardboard sheets are manufactured.

We, were then grouped into teams of two to assist the staff in conducting events and the children,were grouped according to their age.

President of Rotaract BMSCE, Ajay Gopal ,rightly put it across "We are all only temporarily abled until an eventuality strikes. Let us not sympathize with these students but instead celebrate the day with them and have fun too".

We watched in amazement as the children descended down the stairs in perfect lines and formed groups as instructed.Events such as long jump,short put,musical chair and running races with skipping ropes and balancing a lemon on a spoon were organized. We were all reminded of our school days and yet there was something about the ambiance that mystified us all.

To quote Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharishi "Mind is the consciousness which has put on limitations.You are originally unlimited and perfect." These special children showed us how simple it is to not be bounded by our web of constraints or limitations. They felt their way across chairs, strutted across invisible ropes and ran races without the fear of an obstacle ahead.

Rotaractor Shruti Sheshadri says "The children in Ramana Maharishi School show us all a new perspective in life.You are not blind if you cannot see but only if you lack vision.The inquisitiveness of the children and their motivation to learn something new everyday is a big takeaway for all of us."

After all the events were conducted we made our way to a common dining hall and enjoyed a sumptuous meal with all the students. Our Saturday could not have been more productive.
