Hi!

I'm Pavithra Raghunathan (Pavi).

This is my little corner of the internet. Welcome!

I love bunnies, Classical Music and Remote Sensing (not the spooky kind!).I currently am working on making Greenhouses act like lighthouses for Radar Satellites. It's fun!

I love the sheer amount of things we can do with satellite data.

In this blog, I write my thoughts and opinions on this and many more topics.
