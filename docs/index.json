    "description": "An old article I wrote during my time in Rotaract BMSCE",
    "body": "This was an article I Wrote during my time as a volunteer at Rotaract BMSCE.\nThe long trip to Shivanahalli Ashram, lasted almost 2 hours. Shivanahalli, as the name suggests is a quaint little village, which most deforesters have thankfully not discovered. The Ashram, run by RAMAKRISHNA MISSION, has grown more than 3000 trees in an area which was barren before they control. The purpose of our visit there was to help the Ashram in their legitimate efforts to make a greener India.\nThe ashram covering a large area has used most of its land area to plant saplings in the barren areas thereby maintaining a small but fruitful forest. These saplings are envisioned to one day, become a part of the same forest and make a self-sufficient forest ecosystem.\nOur rotaract team, as a team building exercise, watered as many saplings as we could find. For this, we firstly organized ourselves into 2 human chains stretching from the well/tank to the saplings quarter. We then started passing along pots filled with water to the saplings and empty pots ready to be refilled back. Thereby, efficiently delivering water from the tank to the plants. With this exercise, we not only introduced ourselves to the people around us, but we communicated efficiently with the whole chain. After a while, a competition started between the 2 chains on who could water more number of plants!\nThe day was filled with excitement, some misadventures (including a bunch of us getting lost on our way through the forest to the saplings quarter), some tasty lunch and some inspirational stories. The head swamiji of that aashram Swami Vishnumayananda gave us a whole new perspective on life which gave us something to think about on the way home. Not only did we help in making the city/country a tad bit greener but also connected with a team which would be our backbone for our future benevolent events.\nRotaractor Rohit Karthikeyan says “The experience was something to cherish. It was good meeting new people, working together as a team, mitigating contingencies and getting work done. Besides watering the plants our brief moments of interaction with the swamiji was pleasant and insightful. It was a warm break from the routine undergraduate life while being a window for making a valuable contribution to society.”\n",

    "body": "This was an article I Wrote during my time in Rotaract BMSCE.\nSports day at Ramana Maharishi School For The Blind.\n\u0026ldquo;Om sahana vavatu. sahanao bhunaktu. sahaveeryam karavavahai\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.shanti shanti shanti hi\u0026rdquo; rang through the walls of Ramana Maharishi School for the Blind as we entered the school quadrangle on the morning of 8th November,2014.\nA visually impaired teacher briefed our 20 member volunteer base about the school.The school caters to the needs of visually impaired( both complete and partial) and mentally challenged children providing them with food, accommodation and education.They also have a mill within the school premises where cardboard sheets are manufactured.\nWe, were then grouped into teams of two to assist the staff in conducting events and the children,were grouped according to their age.\nPresident of Rotaract BMSCE, Ajay Gopal ,rightly put it across \u0026ldquo;We are all only temporarily abled until an eventuality strikes. Let us not sympathize with these students but instead celebrate the day with them and have fun too\u0026rdquo;.\nWe watched in amazement as the children descended down the stairs in perfect lines and formed groups as instructed.Events such as long jump,short put,musical chair and running races with skipping ropes and balancing a lemon on a spoon were organized. We were all reminded of our school days and yet there was something about the ambiance that mystified us all.\nTo quote Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharishi \u0026ldquo;Mind is the consciousness which has put on limitations.You are originally unlimited and perfect.\u0026rdquo; These special children showed us how simple it is to not be bounded by our web of constraints or limitations. They felt their way across chairs, strutted across invisible ropes and ran races without the fear of an obstacle ahead.\nRotaractor Shruti Sheshadri says \u0026ldquo;The children in Ramana Maharishi School show us all a new perspective in life.You are not blind if you cannot see but only if you lack vision.The inquisitiveness of the children and their motivation to learn something new everyday is a big takeaway for all of us.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter all the events were conducted we made our way to a common dining hall and enjoyed a sumptuous meal with all the students. Our Saturday could not have been more productive.\n",
